# Small Town RAG AI model
This is a small town RAG AI solution for the Town of Lamoni Iowa called Rod Dixon. Rod can tell you anything from facebook posts that are happening in the Town to historical data from over 100 years ago

# backend
the backend contains the vector storage, webscrape, retrieval and api scripts as well as some prototypes pipelines that I exsperimented with.
Currently the RAG model works with cosine similarity search and re-rank. The embedding model that was used is BAAI-M

### Volunteering – A Neighborly Thing to Do

Lamoni's Volunteers Fair was a bustling hub of community partnerships last Tuesday as residents explored volunteer organization tables in the Central Park Garden Area.  The tables lined the path from City Hall to the Community Center, overflowing into the parking lot where the Decatur County Cattleman served up their usual flavorful, juicy burgers to an appreciative crowd. The fair offered a unique chance for locals to connect with local organizations and make a meaningful difference in Lamoni.

As participants strolled along the pathway, enthusiastic representatives from various organizations shared their personal stories of community service.  They discovered a treasure trove of volunteer opportunities.  Many were amazed by the diverse ways residents can contribute, from volunteering to advocacy and expressed interest in becoming involved.  Stories of how neighbors were helped echoed along the line of tables.  “The response was overwhelming, City Administrator Barb Stuck said. "Not only did we have a fantastic turnout of volunteers, but the community also showed incredible enthusiasm."

Next, Tony Crandell surprised Mayor Doug Foster by honoring him for his long-standing service not only as Lamoni’s mayor but also as an EMS volunteer since 2004. In addition to his role as a first responder, Foster dedicates time every day at City Hall to be accessible to the public. Before becoming mayor, he served on the City Council for six years. Crandell presented him with the Lamoni Making a Difference Award plaque and a framed City Hall lithograph in recognition of his contributions.

The Lamoni City Council approved funding for the event which resulted in over 30 organizations signing up to participate.  From long-time friends to new faces, the event drew a energetic crowd eager to learn more about getting involved.  "The Volunteer Fair was a resounding success showcasing the incredible diversity and dedication of the city's volunteers,” Mayor Doug Foster said. “I extend my sincere gratitude to all the volunteers who make our city a thriving community.”

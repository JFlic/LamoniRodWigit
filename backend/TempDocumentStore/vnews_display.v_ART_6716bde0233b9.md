### Tree Planting in North and Central Parks

“The long-awaited tree planting has finally come,” said Mayor Doug Foster, “after a tree drive fundraiser that took place last year.”  Lamoni was fortunate to have raised $11,300 in those efforts.

Trees were ordered through Hynek’s Tree Farm in Beaconsfield, Iowa. Hynek Tree Farm is a family-owned business that specializes in providing a variety of trees for landscaping and decorative purposes for both residential and commercial needs.

Tim Brunner, Lamoni Parks and Recreation Director, coordinated the project to replace trees lost due primarily to the ash borer that killed more than 40 trees in North Park alone. Because the trees lost provided most of the shade at North Park, more mature trees were ordered. Though it will take several years for the trees to reach maturity, having a head start of a base of approximately three inches in diameter, instead of saplings, will give the future canopy a head start.

There is a wide variety of trees in this order including two sunset maple trees to be planted near the library and two blue spruce trees near City Hall in Central Park.

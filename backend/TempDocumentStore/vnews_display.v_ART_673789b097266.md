### Polly's Pop is Pop'n Up in Lamoni

On Tuesday November 5th I was taking a stroll down Main Street, aiming to take a look at a colorful display that now adorns the once dark windows of 119 E Main Street. I had seen the Polly's Pop logo in passing several times over the last few weeks, and was intrigued as I had recalled my father mentioning the brand being a favorite of his youth growing up in the Independence/Kansas City Missouri area.
